I changed page number for almost each page, so there are most pages were unique. It led to decrease of hit/miss ratio. (it is very logical, because at almost every memeory access we do not have such page in page frame)
And I did vice versa: made amost all page numbers equivalent, so every memory access program has found required page in page frame -> hit/miss ratio increased significantly
1) I made almost all pages with unique page number
2) I made almost all pages with different page number
